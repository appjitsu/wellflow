# This file contains security vulnerabilities that have been reviewed and accepted
# Each entry should include:
# - Vulnerability ID
# - Package name and version
# - Justification for ignoring
# - Review date and reviewer
# - Expiration date for re-evaluation

# Format:
# VULNERABILITY_ID:PACKAGE_NAME:VERSION:JUSTIFICATION:REVIEWER:DATE:EXPIRES

# Example entries (remove when adding real entries):
# GHSA-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx:example-package:1.0.0:Development only dependency:security-team:2024-01-15:2024-04-15

# Development Dependencies
# These are dependencies used only in development and not in production builds
# Lower risk tolerance for development dependencies

# Production Dependencies  
# These are dependencies that ship with the production application
# Higher scrutiny required - only ignore after thorough security review

# Notes:
# - All ignored vulnerabilities must be approved by security team
# - Regular review of ignored vulnerabilities is required
# - Expiration dates ensure periodic re-evaluation
# - Document mitigation strategies where applicable

# Oil & Gas Compliance Notes:
# - Critical infrastructure applications require enhanced security review
# - All ignored vulnerabilities must be documented in compliance reports
# - Regular security audits must review all ignored items
# - Emergency procedures must be in place for critical vulnerability discovery
