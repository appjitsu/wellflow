          - 🔍 **Code Quality**: ESLint + Prettier
          - 🛡️ **Security**: SAST + Secrets scanning
          - 📝 **Type Safety**: TypeScript strict mode

          ## Test Coverage by Application

          ### API Application
          - **Target**: 80% minimum coverage
          - **Focus**: Domain logic, business rules, data validation
          - **Critical**: Oil & gas regulatory compliance

          ### Web Application  
          - **Target**: 80% minimum coverage
          - **Focus**: User interactions, component behavior
          - **Critical**: Real-time monitoring interfaces

          ## Next Steps

          1. Review coverage gaps and add targeted tests
          2. Ensure critical business logic is fully tested
          3. Maintain coverage above 80% threshold
          4. Regular coverage monitoring and reporting
