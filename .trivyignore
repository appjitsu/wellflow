# Trivy Security Scanner Ignore File
# This file specifies vulnerabilities to ignore during scanning

# Development environment specific ignores
# These should be reviewed and removed for production

# Low severity vulnerabilities in development dependencies
CVE-2023-26136  # tough-cookie vulnerability in dev dependencies
CVE-2023-26115  # word-wrap vulnerability in dev dependencies

# Node.js base image vulnerabilities that are acceptable for development
# These should be regularly reviewed and updated

# Alpine package vulnerabilities that are patched in newer versions
# Update base images regularly to address these

# Development-only packages with known low-risk vulnerabilities
# Remove these ignores for production builds

# Oil & Gas industry specific considerations:
# - Ensure all production images are scanned without ignores
# - Regular security updates for industrial control systems
