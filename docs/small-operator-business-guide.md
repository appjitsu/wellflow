## What is a Small/Micro Oil & Gas Operator?

### Definition & Scale

A **small or micro oil & gas operator** is an independent company that explores
for, develops, and produces oil and natural gas from underground reservoirs.
Unlike major oil companies (ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP), these are typically:

- **Micro Operators**: 1-10 wells, often family-owned businesses
- **Small Operators**: 11-50 wells, small corporations or partnerships
- **Revenue Range**: $500,000 to $50 million annually\*
- **Employee Count**: 2-25 employees\*
- **Geographic Focus**: Usually operate within a single region or basin

### Business Model

Small operators make money by:

1. **Drilling new wells** to find oil and gas
2. **Producing and selling** oil and gas from existing wells
3. **Buying and selling** mineral rights and existing wells
4. **Partnering with others** to share costs and risks

## How Oil & Gas Production Works

### The Basics

Oil and natural gas are found in underground rock formations called
**reservoirs**. Think of these like underground sponges that hold oil and gas in
tiny spaces between rock particles.

### The Production Process

#### 1. **Exploration & Leasing**

- Operators lease mineral rights from landowners (farmers, ranchers, etc.)
- They pay an upfront **bonus** and ongoing **royalty payments** (typically
  12.5-25% of production value)
- Geological studies identify potential drilling locations

#### 2. **Drilling**

- A drilling rig creates a hole (wellbore) thousands of feet deep
- **Vertical wells**: Drill straight down (older technology)
- **Horizontal wells**: Drill down then sideways to access more reservoir
- **Hydraulic fracturing (fracking)**: Pump water, sand, and chemicals to crack
  rock and release oil/gas

#### 3. **Completion**

- Install production equipment: pumps, pipes, tanks, separators
- Connect to pipelines or truck loading facilities
- Begin producing oil and gas

#### 4. **Production**

- Oil and gas flow from the reservoir through the wellbore to surface equipment
- **Artificial lift**: Many wells need pumps to bring fluids to surface
- **Separation**: Oil, gas, and water are separated at the wellsite
- **Storage**: Oil stored in tanks, gas sent to pipelines

#### 5. **Transportation & Sales**

- **Oil**: Trucked to refineries or pipeline terminals
- **Gas**: Sent through pipelines to processing plants
- **Water**: Disposed of in injection wells or recycled

  practice)
- **Texas severance tax rates**: 4.6% for oil, 7.5% for natural gas (Texas
  Comptroller)
- **Artificial lift requirement**: 80% of oil wells require artificial lift
  (multiple industry sources)
- **Well decline rates**: 30-50% first year for unconventional wells (EIA, SPE
  sources)
- **Depletion allowance**: 15% for small producers, limited to 50% of taxable
  income (IRS)

  end (Texas Railroad Commission)

### ⚠️ **Information Requiring Further Validation**

Items marked with (\*) in the document represent estimates or ranges that should
be verified for specific applications:

#### **Financial Metrics**

- **Revenue ranges** ($500K-$50M): Based on well count and production estimates,
  not industry surveys
- **Employee counts** (2-25): Estimated based on operational requirements,
  varies widely
- **LOE percentages** (30-50%): Industry benchmarks for small operators not
  readily available
- **Profit margins** (10-25% net): Varies significantly by operator efficiency
  and market conditions
- **Equipment costs**: Ranges based on general industry knowledge, actual costs
  vary by vendor and specifications

#### **Operational Costs**

- **Per-well operating expenses**: Costs vary significantly by:
  - Geographic location and accessibility
  - Well age and condition
  - Local service provider rates
  - Regulatory requirements
  - Production volumes and fluid characteristics

#### **Equipment Pricing**

- **Artificial lift systems**: Costs depend on:
  - Well depth and production requirements
  - Installation complexity
  - Local labor rates
  - Equipment specifications and vendors

#### **Regulatory Information**

- **Penalty amounts**: Specific fine structures vary by violation type and
  severity
- **Processing times**: Permit processing varies by complexity and agency
  workload
- **Compliance costs**: Highly dependent on specific regulatory requirements and
  operator circumstances

### 📋 **Recommendations for Users**

1. **Verify local conditions**: Costs, regulations, and practices vary
   significantly by state and region
2. **Consult current sources**: Regulatory requirements and fee schedules change
   frequently
3. **Obtain multiple quotes**: Equipment and service costs vary widely among
   providers
4. **Consider operator-specific factors**: Size, location, and operational
   efficiency significantly impact all metrics
5. **Update regularly**: Industry conditions, regulations, and costs change
   continuously
