## Security Vulnerability Response

### Step 1: Initial Assessment (0-15 minutes)

#### Immediate Actions

1. **Acknowledge the Alert**

   ```bash
   # Log incident start time
   echo "$(date): Security incident detected - ID: SEC-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)" >> security-incidents.log
   ```

2. **Assess Severity**
   - Review vulnerability details
   - Determine affected systems
   - Evaluate potential impact
   - Classify severity level

3. **Initial Containment**

   ```bash
   # For critical vulnerabilities, consider immediate actions:
   # - Disable affected endpoints
   # - Revoke compromised credentials
   # - Isolate affected systems
   ```

#### Critical Vulnerability Checklist

- [ ] Production systems affected?
- [ ] Customer data at risk?
- [ ] SCADA/industrial systems involved?
- [ ] Active exploitation detected?
- [ ] Regulatory compliance implications?

### Step 2: Notification and Escalation (15-30 minutes)

#### Notification Matrix

```
CRITICAL: CISO + CTO + Legal + On-call engineer
HIGH:     Security lead + Engineering manager + DevOps
MEDIUM:   Team lead + Assigned developer
LOW:      Standard ticket assignment
```

#### Communication Template

```
SECURITY INCIDENT ALERT
Severity: [CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]
ID: SEC-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS
Affected Systems: [List systems]
Initial Assessment: [Brief description]
Assigned To: [Name]
Next Update: [Time]
```

### Step 3: Investigation and Analysis (30 minutes - 2 hours)

#### Evidence Collection

1. **System Logs**

   ```bash
   # Collect relevant logs
   kubectl logs -n wellflow --since=1h > incident-logs.txt
   docker logs wellflow-api >> incident-logs.txt
   ```

2. **Security Scan Results**

   ```bash
   # Run immediate security scans
   pnpm run security:full
   semgrep --config=.semgrep.yml --json > incident-scan.json
   ```

3. **Network Analysis**

   ```bash
   # Check for suspicious network activity
   netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED
   ss -tuln | grep :3000
   ```

#### Root Cause Analysis

- [ ] Vulnerability source identified
- [ ] Attack vector understood
- [ ] Scope of impact determined
- [ ] Timeline of events established
- [ ] Contributing factors identified

### Step 4: Containment and Mitigation (Immediate)

#### Immediate Containment Actions

```bash
# Example containment procedures

# 1. Isolate affected services
docker-compose down wellflow-api

# 2. Revoke compromised credentials
kubectl delete secret api-credentials
kubectl create secret generic api-credentials --from-literal=key=new-secure-key

# 3. Apply emergency patches
git checkout security-patch-branch
pnpm run build
pnpm run deploy:emergency

# 4. Enable additional monitoring
kubectl apply -f monitoring/security-enhanced.yaml
```

#### Quality Gate Bypass (Emergency Only)

```bash
# Emergency deployment bypass (requires dual approval)
export EMERGENCY_BYPASS=true
export BYPASS_APPROVER_1="[Name]"
export BYPASS_APPROVER_2="[Name]"
export BYPASS_REASON="Critical security patch for CVE-XXXX"

# Deploy with bypass
pnpm run deploy:emergency --bypass-gates
```

### Step 5: Resolution and Recovery (2-24 hours)

#### Permanent Fix Implementation

1. **Code Changes**

   ```bash
   # Create security fix branch
   git checkout -b security-fix/CVE-XXXX-YYYY

   # Implement fix
   # ... make necessary changes ...

   # Test fix
   pnpm run test:security
   pnpm run security:full

   # Deploy fix
   git commit -m "Security fix for CVE-XXXX-YYYY"
   git push origin security-fix/CVE-XXXX-YYYY
   ```

2. **Validation Testing**

   ```bash
   # Verify fix effectiveness
   pnpm run security:api
   pnpm run security:infrastructure

   # Performance impact assessment
   pnpm run performance:analyze

   # Accessibility validation
   pnpm run accessibility:test
   ```

3. **Deployment Verification**

   ```bash
   # Post-deployment validation
   curl -f https://api.wellflow.com/health
   pnpm run test:integration
   ```

### Step 6: Post-Incident Activities (24-72 hours)
