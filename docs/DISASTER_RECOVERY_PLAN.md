## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive disaster recovery procedures for the
WellFlow oil & gas production monitoring platform. It provides step-by-step
instructions for recovering from various disaster scenarios while maintaining
business continuity and regulatory compliance.

## Recovery Objectives

### Recovery Time Objective (RTO)

- **Critical Systems**: 4 hours maximum
- **Production API**: 2 hours maximum
- **Web Dashboard**: 4 hours maximum
- **Mobile App Backend**: 2 hours maximum
- **Reporting Systems**: 8 hours maximum

### Recovery Point Objective (RPO)

- **Production Data**: 1 hour maximum data loss
- **Well Configuration**: 15 minutes maximum data loss
- **User Data**: 1 hour maximum data loss
- **System Logs**: 24 hours maximum data loss

## Disaster Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Database Failure

**Impact**: Complete loss of PostgreSQL database **Probability**: Low **Recovery
Priority**: Critical (P0)

### Scenario 2: Application Server Failure

**Impact**: API and web services unavailable **Probability**: Medium **Recovery
Priority**: Critical (P0)

### Scenario 3: Redis Cache Failure

**Impact**: Performance degradation, session loss **Probability**: Medium
**Recovery Priority**: High (P1)

### Scenario 4: Railway Platform Outage

**Impact**: Complete service unavailability **Probability**: Low **Recovery
Priority**: Critical (P0)

### Scenario 5: Data Corruption

**Impact**: Partial or complete data integrity loss **Probability**: Low
**Recovery Priority**: Critical (P0)

## Recovery Procedures

### Database Recovery

#### Step 1: Assess Database Status

```bash
# Check database connectivity
pg_isready -h $DB_HOST -p $DB_PORT -U $DB_USER -d $DB_NAME

# Check Railway database status
railway status

# Review recent logs
railway logs --service postgres
```

#### Step 2: Restore from Backup

```bash
# Navigate to backup directory
cd /path/to/backups

# Find latest backup
ls -la wellflow-full-prod-*.dump | tail -1

# Restore database (custom format)
pg_restore \
  --host=$DB_HOST \
  --port=$DB_PORT \
  --username=$DB_USER \
  --dbname=$DB_NAME \
  --clean \
  --if-exists \
  --verbose \
  wellflow-full-prod-YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.dump

# Verify restoration
psql -h $DB_HOST -p $DB_PORT -U $DB_USER -d $DB_NAME -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM wells;"
```

#### Step 3: Validate Data Integrity

```bash
# Run data integrity checks
pnpm run db:validate

# Check critical tables
psql -h $DB_HOST -p $DB_PORT -U $DB_USER -d $DB_NAME << EOF
SELECT 'wells' as table_name, COUNT(*) as record_count FROM wells
UNION ALL
SELECT 'production_data', COUNT(*) FROM production_data
UNION ALL
SELECT 'users', COUNT(*) FROM users;
EOF
```

### Application Recovery

#### Step 1: Deploy from Git Repository

```bash
# Clone latest stable version
git clone https://github.com/appjitsu/wellflow.git
cd wellflow
git checkout main

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build applications
pnpm run build

# Deploy to Railway
railway up
```

#### Step 2: Restore Configuration

```bash
# Restore environment variables from backup
# (Manual process - retrieve from secure backup location)

# Set critical environment variables
railway variables set DB_HOST=$BACKUP_DB_HOST
railway variables set DB_PASSWORD=$BACKUP_DB_PASSWORD
railway variables set REDIS_URL=$BACKUP_REDIS_URL

# Verify configuration
railway variables
```

#### Step 3: Validate Application Health

```bash
# Check API health
curl -f https://api.wellflow.com/health

# Check web application
curl -f https://wellflow.com

# Run integration tests
pnpm run test:integration
```

### Redis Recovery

#### Step 1: Restore Redis Data

```bash
# For RDB backup restoration
redis-cli -h $REDIS_HOST -p $REDIS_PORT flushall
redis-cli -h $REDIS_HOST -p $REDIS_PORT --rdb /path/to/backup.rdb

# For command-based backup restoration
redis-cli -h $REDIS_HOST -p $REDIS_PORT < redis-dump-backup.txt
```

#### Step 2: Verify Cache Functionality

```bash
# Test Redis connectivity
redis-cli -h $REDIS_HOST -p $REDIS_PORT ping

# Check key restoration
redis-cli -h $REDIS_HOST -p $REDIS_PORT keys '*'

# Test application cache
curl -f https://api.wellflow.com/api/wells | jq '.data | length'
```
