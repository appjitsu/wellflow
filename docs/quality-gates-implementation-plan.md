# Quality Gates & Security Scanning Implementation Plan

**Ticket**: KAN-23 - Implement Quality Gates & Security Scanning  
**Branch**: `feat/quality-gates-security-scanning`  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Assignee**: Jason Cochran  

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive implementation plan for quality gates and security scanning across the WellFlow oil & gas production monitoring platform. The implementation ensures enterprise-grade code quality, security compliance, and regulatory adherence required for critical oil & gas operations.

## Objectives

- **Code Quality**: Enforce consistent coding standards and best practices
- **Security**: Implement comprehensive security scanning and vulnerability management
- **Compliance**: Meet oil & gas industry regulatory requirements
- **Automation**: Integrate all quality gates into CI/CD pipeline
- **Performance**: Ensure application performance meets production standards
- **Accessibility**: Comply with WCAG 2.1 AA standards for regulatory requirements

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Code Quality & Standards)
1. **ESLint Security Configuration**
   - Configure eslint-plugin-security
   - Set up @typescript-eslint with strict rules
   - Add oil & gas compliance-specific rules
   - Ensure consistency across web, api, and docs apps

2. **Code Formatting & Pre-commit Hooks**
   - Configure Prettier with consistent rules
   - Set up husky and lint-staged
   - Enforce formatting standards before commits

3. **TypeScript Strict Mode**
   - Enable strict mode across all packages
   - Configure strict compiler options
   - Add type checking to CI pipeline

### Phase 2: Security Scanning
4. **Vulnerability Scanning**
   - Implement npm audit and Snyk integration
   - Configure automated dependency scanning
   - Set up critical vulnerability alerts

5. **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**
   - Configure CodeQL or Semgrep
   - Focus on OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
   - Add Node.js and React-specific security rules

6. **Secrets Management**
   - Set up GitLeaks or TruffleHog
   - Configure GitHub secret scanning
   - Prevent sensitive data commits

### Phase 3: Quality Analysis & Testing
7. **Code Quality Analysis**
   - Set up SonarQube Cloud integration
   - Configure quality gates for maintainability
   - Integrate with GitHub PR checks

8. **Test Coverage Requirements**
   - Configure Jest coverage reporting
   - Set 80% minimum coverage threshold
   - Add coverage gates to CI pipeline

9. **Performance & Accessibility**
   - Set up Lighthouse CI for performance budgets
   - Configure axe-core for accessibility testing
   - Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

### Phase 4: Infrastructure & API Security
10. **Container Security**
    - Configure Docker image scanning with Trivy
    - Scan base images and application containers
    - Use minimal, secure base images

11. **API Security Testing**
    - Set up OWASP ZAP for API testing
    - Test for SQL injection, XSS, auth bypasses
    - Configure automated API security scans

12. **Infrastructure as Code Security**
    - Configure Checkov or Terrascan
    - Scan Docker files and K8s manifests
    - Check for security misconfigurations

### Phase 5: Compliance & Monitoring
13. **License Compliance**
    - Scan for GPL, AGPL, and restrictive licenses
    - Ensure commercial compatibility
    - Generate license compliance reports

14. **Dependency Monitoring**
    - Set up GitHub Dependabot
    - Configure automatic security updates
    - Monitor for new vulnerabilities

15. **CI/CD Pipeline Integration**
    - Create comprehensive GitHub Actions workflows
    - Configure branch protection rules
    - Require all quality gates to pass

### Phase 6: Documentation & Processes
16. **Documentation & Runbooks**
    - Document all quality gates and processes
    - Create security incident response procedures
    - Establish emergency bypass protocols

## Success Criteria

- ✅ All code passes ESLint security rules
- ✅ 100% code formatting compliance via Prettier
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode enabled with zero errors
- ✅ Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- ✅ 80%+ test coverage across all packages
- ✅ SonarQube quality gate passes
- ✅ Performance budgets met (Core Web Vitals)
- ✅ WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- ✅ Container images pass security scans
- ✅ API security tests pass
- ✅ License compliance verified
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline enforces all quality gates

## Oil & Gas Industry Compliance

This implementation addresses specific requirements for oil & gas operations:

- **Regulatory Compliance**: WCAG 2.1 AA for accessibility requirements
- **Security Standards**: Enterprise-grade security scanning for critical infrastructure
- **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring of quality gates
- **Performance Requirements**: Strict performance budgets for real-time monitoring
- **License Compliance**: Commercial-friendly licensing for proprietary software

## Next Steps

1. Start with Phase 1 (Foundation) tasks
2. Implement security scanning in Phase 2
3. Progress through phases systematically
4. Test each implementation thoroughly
5. Document processes and create runbooks
6. Train team on new quality gates and processes

This comprehensive approach ensures WellFlow meets enterprise-grade quality and security standards required for critical oil & gas production monitoring operations.
