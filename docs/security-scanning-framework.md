## 🔍 Troubleshooting Security Tests

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### **False Positive: OT Endpoint Warnings**

```
⚠️ OT endpoint /ot/devices detected - ensure proper network segmentation
```

**Root Cause**: Security test logic bug - treats 404 responses as endpoint
detection **Resolution**: These are false positives. The endpoints return proper
404 responses, indicating correct isolation. **Fix**: Update security test to
check HTTP status codes:

```javascript
// Current (incorrect) logic
try {
  const response = await this.makeRequest('GET', endpoint);
  // Triggers warning for ANY response (including 404)
} catch (error) {
  // Only triggers for network errors
}

// Correct logic
try {
  const response = await this.makeRequest('GET', endpoint);
  if (response.statusCode === 200) {
    // Actual endpoint detected - WARNING
  } else {
    // 404/403/etc - properly isolated - PASSED
  }
} catch (error) {
  // Network error - properly isolated - PASSED
}
```

#### **GitLeaks Installation Issues**

```
GitLeaks not installed - skipping secrets scan
```

**Resolution**:

```bash
# macOS
brew install gitleaks

# Linux
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trufflesecurity/gitleaks/main/scripts/install.sh | sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin

# Verify installation
gitleaks version
```

#### **API Server Not Starting for Tests**

```
⚠️ API not accessible, attempting to start API server...
```

**Resolution**:

```bash
# Check if port 3001 is in use
lsof -ti:3001

# Kill existing processes
kill $(lsof -ti:3001)

# Start API server manually
cd apps/api && pnpm run start:dev
```

### Security Test Configuration

#### **Environment Variables**

```bash
# .env configuration for security testing
API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001
SECURITY_SCAN_TIMEOUT=30000
RATE_LIMIT_TEST_REQUESTS=100
ENABLE_OT_TESTING=true
ENABLE_SCADA_TESTING=true
```

#### **Custom Security Rules**

```javascript
// scripts/security-config.js
module.exports = {
  owasp: {
    enabled: true,
    skipTests: [], // Skip specific tests if needed
  },
  industrial: {
    otEndpoints: ['/ot/devices', '/ot/networks', '/ot/protocols'],
    scadaEndpoints: ['/scada/hmi', '/scada/historian'],
    protocolEndpoints: ['/modbus/read', '/dnp3/data'],
  },
  compliance: {
    nist: true,
    iec62443: true,
    api1164: true,
  },
};
```
