This document consolidates comprehensive research on upstream oil and gas
operator business operations, market analysis, and competitive landscape to
inform WellFlow's product development and go-to-market strategy.

## Executive Summary

Research validates a significant market opportunity for WellFlow's
software-first approach targeting small and micro oil & gas operators (1-100
wells). The upstream sector faces substantial compliance burdens consuming 5-20%
of annual revenue, while existing solutions leave critical gaps in regulatory
automation and integrated business management.

**Key Research Findings:**

- **Market Size**: $52.1 billion projected market size by 2032 (15.1% CAGR)
- **Compliance Burden**: Small operators spend 5-20% of revenue on regulatory
  compliance
- **Technology Gap**: 70% coverage gap between existing solutions and industry
  requirements
- **Pricing Opportunity**: Clear market gap between simple tools
  ($200-400/month) and enterprise solutions ($1,000-5,000/month)
- **Customer Pain Points**: Manual processes dominate operations, regulatory
  compliance, and financial management

## 1. Upstream Operator Business Model Analysis

### 1.1 Operator Roles and Responsibilities

**Legal Authority and Fiduciary Duties**

Operators derive authority from Joint Operating Agreements (JOA) and serve as
central orchestrators of complex multi-party ventures:

  reasonable and prudent operations

**Decision Authority Thresholds**

- **Operator Authority** (<$50,000): Day-to-day operations, routine maintenance
- **AFE Required** ($50,000-$500,000): Workovers, facility upgrades
- **Operating Committee** (>$500,000): Major projects, drilling operations
- **Special Consent** (>75% vote): Abandonment, major facility construction

**Natural Gas Sales**

- Sold by thousand cubic feet (MCF) or million BTU (MMBTU)
- Often associated with oil production
- Example: 200 MCF/day × $3/MCF × 365 days = $219K annually

**Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs)**

- Higher value than raw natural gas
- Requires processing infrastructure

### 3.2 Cost Structure Analysis

**Lease Operating Expenses (LOE) - 30-50% of revenue**

- Electricity: $2,000-$10,000/well/year

- Non-operating partners: 50-75% combined, provide capital
- Revenue distribution based on working interest percentages

**Monthly JIB Process**

- Operator bills partners for their share of costs
- Detailed breakdown of drilling, completion, and operating expenses
- Partners have 30 days to pay or dispute charges
- Comprehensive audit trails required for partner relations

## 4. Regulatory Environment and Compliance

### 4.1 Multi-Level Regulatory Framework

**Federal Regulations**
