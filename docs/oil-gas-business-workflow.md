### 2. **Production Allocation**

- Daily production must be allocated to all interest owners
- Allocation based on division of interest (DOI) percentages
- Revenue calculated using posted prices or contracts
- Deductions for transportation, processing, taxes

### 3. **Joint Interest Billing (JIB)**

- Operating costs shared among working interest owners
- Monthly billing statements to non-operators

## Conclusion

Our comprehensive analysis reveals that **our current database schema covers
approximately 35% of industry-standard requirements** - significantly lower than
initially estimated. While our foundation is solid, achieving industry viability
requires implementing **25+ additional tables** and significantly enhancing
existing functionality.

**Key Strengths:**

- Solid core business entities (organizations, users, leases, wells)
- Good production tracking foundation (70% coverage)
- Basic partner management and JIB framework
- Multi-tenant architecture ready for scaling

**Critical Gaps Identified:**

- **Financial Operations** (20% coverage) - AFE management, cost tracking, GL
  integration
- **Revenue Distribution** (30% coverage) - Division orders, owner payments,
  revenue accounting
- **Environmental Compliance** (50% coverage) - Incident tracking, emissions
  reporting
- **Reserves Management** (0% coverage) - SEC reporting, decline curves,
  forecasting
- **Land Management** (40% coverage) - Title management, curative tracking
- **Drilling Operations** (30% coverage) - Daily drilling reports, well logs,
  completions

**Critical Success Factors:**

1. **Phase 1 implementation is essential** for basic industry viability
2. **Financial operations must be prioritized** for business sustainability
3. **Environmental compliance cannot be delayed** due to regulatory requirements
4. **Reserves management is mandatory** for SEC reporting compliance

**Expected Outcome:**

Following this roadmap will transform WellFlow from a basic production tracking
system (35% coverage) to a comprehensive upstream operations platform (90%+
coverage), positioning it as an industry-leading solution capable of competing
with established oil and gas software providers.

The investment in these enhancements will enable WellFlow to provide genuine
value to upstream operators and meet the complex requirements of modern oil and
gas operations.
