# Complete Operator's Guide to Upstream Oil & Gas Business Management

## Executive Overview

As an operator in the upstream oil and gas industry, you serve as the central
orchestrator of complex multi-party ventures, managing everything from initial
exploration through production operations. This guide provides a comprehensive
framework for managing operator responsibilities, stakeholder relationships, and
business processes.

## Part 1: Operator Fundamentals and Authority

### 1.1 Operator Designation and Responsibilities

**Legal Authority**: Operators derive their authority from the Joint Operating
Agreement (JOA), which grants exclusive right to conduct operations on behalf of
all working interest owners. This includes:

- Conducting all operations on the joint property
- Making day-to-day operational decisions
- Entering into contracts for goods and services
- Managing regulatory compliance and reporting
- Collecting and distributing revenues
- Billing non-operators for their share of costs

**Fiduciary Duties**: As operator, you have a fiduciary responsibility to:

- Act in good faith for the benefit of all parties
- Maintain reasonable and prudent operations
- Avoid conflicts of interest
- Provide accurate and timely reporting
- Maintain adequate insurance coverage

### 1.2 Operating Standards and Decision Authority

**Operational Standards**: Operations must meet:

- "Good oilfield practice" standards
- All applicable laws and regulations
- Reasonable and prudent operator standards
- Industry best practices and safety protocols

**Decision Thresholds**: Typical authority levels:

- **Operator Authority** (<$50,000): Day-to-day operations, routine maintenance
