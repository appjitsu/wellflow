### PWA Service Worker

```typescript
// Service worker for offline functionality
self.addEventListener('fetch', (event) => {
  if (event.request.url.includes('/api/')) {
    event.respondWith(
      caches.match(event.request).then((response) => {
        if (response) {
          return response;
        }
        return fetch(event.request).then((response) => {
          const responseClone = response.clone();
          caches.open('api-cache').then((cache) => {
            cache.put(event.request, responseClone);
          });
          return response;
        });
      })
    );
  }
});
```

### Offline Data Management

```typescript
// Offline data synchronization service
@Injectable()
export class OfflineDataService {
  private db: IDBDatabase;
  private syncQueue: OfflineOperation[] = [];

  async saveOfflineData(data: any, operation: string): Promise<void> {
    // Store data in IndexedDB
    // Add to sync queue
    // Update UI with offline indicator
  }

  async syncWhenOnline(): Promise<void> {
    if (navigator.onLine) {
      // Process sync queue
      // Handle conflicts
      // Update local data
      // Clear completed operations
    }
  }
}
```

### Mobile-Responsive Components

```typescript
// Touch-optimized production entry component
@Component({
  selector: 'app-mobile-production-entry',
  template: `
    <div class="mobile-form-container">
      <div class="touch-input-group">
        <label>Oil Production (BBL)</label>
        <input
          type="number"
          inputmode="decimal"
          class="touch-input"
          [(ngModel)]="production.oil"
        />
      </div>
      <button class="touch-button primary" (click)="saveProduction()">
        Save Production
      </button>
    </div>
  `,
})

}
```

### Photo Capture Service

```typescript
// Camera and photo management service
@Injectable()
export class PhotoCaptureService {
  async capturePhoto(wellId: string): Promise<Photo> {
    // Access device camera
    // Capture photo with GPS coordinates
    // Compress and optimize image
    // Store locally if offline
    // Queue for upload when online
  }

  async uploadPhotos(): Promise<void> {
