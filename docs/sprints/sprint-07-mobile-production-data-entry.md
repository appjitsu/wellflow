  wellId: z.string().uuid(),
  productionDate: z.date(),
  oilVolume: z.number().min(0).max(10000), // BBL (barrels)
  gasVolume: z.number().min(0).max(100000), // MCF (thousand cubic feet)
  waterVolume: z.number().min(0).max(10000), // BBL (barrels)
  equipmentReadings: z.object({
    pumpStrokes: z.number().min(0).max(30), // Strokes per minute
    casingPressure: z.number().min(0).max(5000), // PSI
    tubingPressure: z.number().min(0).max(5000), // PSI
  }),
  notes: z.string().max(500).optional(),
  photos: z.array(z.string()).max(5),
});
```

### GPS Integration

```typescript
// Location verification
interface LocationData {
  latitude: number;
  longitude: number;
  accuracy: number;
  timestamp: number;
}

const verifyWellLocation = (
  currentLocation: LocationData,
  wellLocation: LocationData,
  toleranceMeters: number = 100
): boolean => {
  const distance = calculateDistance(currentLocation, wellLocation);
  return distance <= toleranceMeters;
};
```

### Photo Management

```typescript
// Photo capture and storage
interface PhotoAttachment {
  id: string;
  uri: string;
  filename: string;
  size: number;
  mimeType: string;
  timestamp: number;
  gpsLocation?: LocationData;
}
```
