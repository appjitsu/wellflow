    legal compliance, workforce inclusion

### âœ… Sprint 14: Security Performance Optimization

**New Sections Added:**

#### 6. Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP)

- **Real-Time Threat Protection**
  - Implement RASP agent for zero-day protection
  - Add insider threat detection patterns
  - Create real-time security event monitoring
  - Set up automated threat response and blocking
