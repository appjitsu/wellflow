## Technical Requirements

### Offline Architecture

```typescript
// Local database schema (WatermelonDB)
const wellSchema = tableSchema({
  name: 'wells',
  columns: [
    { name: 'server_id', type: 'string', isOptional: true },
    { name: 'api_number', type: 'string' },
    { name: 'well_name', type: 'string' },
    { name: 'status', type: 'string' },
    { name: 'last_synced', type: 'number', isOptional: true },
    { name: 'is_dirty', type: 'boolean' },
  ],
});

// Sync strategy
interface SyncOperation {
  type: 'CREATE' | 'UPDATE' | 'DELETE';
  entity: string;
  localId: string;
  serverId?: string;
  data: any;
  timestamp: number;
}
```

### Authentication Flow

```typescript
// Token management
interface AuthTokens {
  accessToken: string;
  refreshToken: string;
  expiresAt: number;
}

// Secure storage
const storeTokens = async (tokens: AuthTokens) => {
  await Keychain.setInternetCredentials(
    'wellflow_tokens',
    'user',
    JSON.stringify(tokens)
  );
};
```

### Performance Requirements

- App startup time: < 3 seconds on average devices
- Offline data access: < 500ms for cached data
- Sync operation: Complete within 30 seconds for typical dataset
- Memory usage: < 100MB for normal operation

    Mobile->>Local DB: Store data locally
    Mobile->>Sync Queue: Add to sync queue
    Sync Service->>API: Upload changes
    API->>Sync Service: Return server data
    Sync Service->>Local DB: Update with server data
    Sync Service->>Mobile: Notify sync complete
```

## Offline Data Strategy

### Data Storage

- **WatermelonDB**: Reactive local database
- **SQLite**: Underlying storage engine
- **Lazy loading**: Load data as needed
- **Caching**: Intelligent data caching

### Sync Mechanisms

- **Optimistic updates**: Update UI immediately
- **Conflict resolution**: Last-write-wins with user notification
- **Batch operations**: Efficient bulk synchronization
- **Background sync**: Sync when app is backgrounded

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection

- Local database encryption
- Secure credential storage
- Certificate pinning for API calls
- Biometric authentication integration

### Privacy

- Minimal data collection
- User consent for location access
- Secure data transmission
- Local data cleanup on logout

## Risks & Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **Offline complexity**: Start with simple sync, add complexity gradually
- **Platform differences**: Test thoroughly on both iOS and Android
- **Performance issues**: Profile and optimize early

### User Experience Risks

- **Sync confusion**: Clear sync status indicators
- **Data loss**: Robust conflict resolution
- **Connectivity issues**: Graceful offline handling
