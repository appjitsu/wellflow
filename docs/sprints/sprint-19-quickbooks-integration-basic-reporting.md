## Technical Implementation

### QuickBooks Integration Service

```typescript
// QuickBooks Online API integration
@Injectable()
export class QuickBooksIntegrationService {
  private qboClient: QuickBooksClient;

  async authenticateCustomer(organizationId: string): Promise<AuthResult> {
    // OAuth 2.0 flow implementation
    // Token storage and management
    // Connection validation
  }

  async syncRevenue(revenueData: RevenueData): Promise<SyncResult> {
    // Create journal entries in QuickBooks
    // Map accounts and categories
    // Handle errors and retries
    // Update sync status
  }

  async createJournalEntry(entry: JournalEntryData): Promise<QBJournalEntry> {
    // Format data for QuickBooks API
    // Create journal entry
    // Validate posting
    // Return confirmation
  }
}
```

### PDF Report Generation

```typescript
// PDF report generation service
@Injectable()
export class ReportGenerationService {
  async generateProductionReport(
    organizationId: string,
    reportParams: ReportParameters
  ): Promise<PDFBuffer> {
    // Query production data
    // Apply report template
    // Generate charts and graphs
    // Create PDF document
    // Return PDF buffer
  }

  async scheduleReport(reportConfig: ReportSchedule): Promise<ScheduleResult> {
    // Create scheduled job
    // Set delivery preferences
    // Configure report parameters
    // Enable/disable schedule
  }
}
```

### Report Template Engine

```typescript
// Template-based report generation
export class ReportTemplateEngine {
  async renderTemplate(
    templateName: string,
    data: ReportData
  ): Promise<HTMLString> {
    // Load report template
    // Bind data to template
    // Apply formatting rules
    // Generate HTML output
  }

  async generatePDF(html: string): Promise<PDFBuffer> {
    // Convert HTML to PDF
