    emergencies like hurricanes

## Technical Requirements

### Authentication Architecture

```typescript
// JWT token structure
interface JWTPayload {
  sub: string; // User ID
  email: string; // User email
  organizationId: string; // Tenant ID
  role: UserRole; // User role
  iat: number; // Issued at
  exp: number; // Expires at
}

// Role definitions
enum UserRole {
  OWNER = 'owner', // Full access
  MANAGER = 'manager', // Operations access
  PUMPER = 'pumper', // Field data entry only
}
```

### CASL Permission System

```typescript
// Permission definitions
const permissions = {
  owner: ['manage', 'all'],
  manager: [
    'read',
    'wells',
    'create',
    'production',
    'read',
    'compliance',
    'update',
    'equipment',
  ],
  pumper: ['create', 'production', 'read', 'wells', 'update', 'production'],
};
```

### Security Requirements

- Password minimum 8 characters with complexity
- JWT tokens expire in 15 minutes (access) / 7 days (refresh)
- Account lockout after 5 failed login attempts
- Email verification required for account activation
- Audit logging for all authentication events

## Acceptance Criteria

### Authentication System

- [ ] Users can register with email verification
- [ ] Users can login with email and password
- [ ] JWT tokens are issued and validated correctly
- [ ] Refresh tokens work for seamless re-authentication
- [ ] Logout invalidates tokens properly
- [ ] Failed login attempts are tracked and limited

### Role-Based Access Control

- [ ] Owners can access all features and data
- [ ] Managers can access operations but not billing
- [ ] Pumpers can only enter production data
- [ ] API endpoints enforce role-based permissions
- [ ] UI shows/hides features based on user role
- [ ] Multi-tenant isolation prevents cross-organization access

### User Management

- [ ] Owners can invite new team members
- [ ] Role assignments work correctly
- [ ] User accounts can be activated/deactivated
- [ ] Profile updates work with proper validation
- [ ] Password changes require current password
- [ ] Account recovery works via email

### Security Features

- [ ] Passwords are hashed with bcrypt
- [ ] Password complexity requirements enforced
- [ ] Account lockout prevents brute force attacks
- [ ] Email verification prevents fake accounts
- [ ] Audit logs capture authentication events
- [ ] Sensitive operations require re-authentication

## Authentication Flow Design

### Registration Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    User->>Frontend: Submit registration
    Frontend->>API: POST /auth/register
    API->>Database: Create user (inactive)
    API->>Email: Send verification email
    API->>Frontend: Registration success
    User->>Email: Click verification link
    Email->>API: GET /auth/verify/:token
    API->>Database: Activate user account
    API->>Frontend: Account verified
```

### Login Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    User->>Frontend: Submit credentials
    Frontend->>API: POST /auth/login
    API->>Database: Validate credentials
    API->>API: Generate JWT tokens
    API->>Frontend: Return tokens
    Frontend->>Frontend: Store tokens
    Frontend->>API: Authenticated requests
```

## Security Considerations

### Password Security

- Bcrypt with minimum 12 rounds
- Password complexity: 8+ chars, mixed case, numbers, symbols
- Password history: prevent reuse of last 5 passwords
- Secure password reset with time-limited tokens

### Token Security

- Short-lived access tokens (15 minutes)
- Secure refresh token rotation
- Token blacklisting on logout
- HTTPS-only token transmission

### Account Protection

- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Account lockout after failed attempts
- Email verification for sensitive changes
- Suspicious activity monitoring

## Risks & Mitigation

### Security Risks

- **Token compromise**: Implement short expiration and rotation
- **Brute force attacks**: Account lockout and rate limiting
- **Email verification bypass**: Secure token generation and validation

### Technical Risks

- **Complex permission logic**: Start simple, add complexity gradually
- **Performance impact**: Optimize permission checking
- **Token management**: Implement proper cleanup and rotation
