    // Classify incident type and severity
    // Trigger regulatory notifications if required
    // Create audit trail entry
  }

  async processRegulatoryNotifications(
    incident: Incident
  ): Promise<NotificationResult[]> {
    // Determine required notifications (OSHA, EPA, state)
    // Generate notification forms
    // Submit to regulatory agencies
    // Track submission status
    // Schedule follow-up requirements
  }
}
```

### Safety Compliance Management
