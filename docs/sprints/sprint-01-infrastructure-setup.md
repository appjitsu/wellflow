  - Monorepo setup with proper folder organization
  - Shared TypeScript configurations
  - ESLint and Prettier configurations
  - Git hooks for code quality enforcement
- **Development Tooling**
  - Docker development environment
  - Database migration tools (Drizzle Kit)
  - API documentation setup (Swagger/OpenAPI)

### 3. Development Quality & Testing

- **Code Quality Tools**
  - ESLint and Prettier configurations
  - Git hooks for code quality enforcement
  - Pre-commit validation
- **Testing Framework**
  - Jest for unit tests
  - Playwright for E2E testing
  - Code coverage tracking

### 4. Monitoring & Observability

- **Error Tracking**
  - Sentry integration for error monitoring
  - LogRocket setup for user session recording
- **Performance Monitoring**
  - API response time tracking
  - Database query performance monitoring
  - Railway built-in monitoring and metrics

## Technical Requirements

### Infrastructure Components

```yaml
Railway Services:
  - NestJS API (Node.js 18+)
  - Next.js Web App (Node.js 18+)
  - Documentation Site
  - PostgreSQL 14+ with TimescaleDB
  - Redis 7+ for caching/jobs
  - Auto-deployment from Git

External Services (Cross-Platform Compatible):
  - Sentry (error tracking - web & mobile)
  - LogRocket (session recording - web & mobile)
  - UploadThing (file storage - web & mobile)
  - Resend (email) / MailPit (local email)
  - Firebase (push notifications, analytics, crashlytics - web & mobile)
  - Mapbox (mapping/GIS - web & mobile SDKs)
  - Twilio (SMS notifications - backend service)
```

### Development Standards

- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled across all projects
- **Code Quality**: ESLint + Prettier with pre-commit hooks
- **Testing**: Jest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E
- **Documentation**: JSDoc for code, OpenAPI for APIs
- **Cross-Platform**: Services selected for compatibility with both Next.js web
  and React Native mobile apps

## Acceptance Criteria

### Infrastructure

- [ ] Railway services deployed and accessible (API, Web, Docs)
- [ ] Database migrations run successfully
- [ ] Redis connection established and tested
- [ ] Custom domain configured with SSL certificates
- [ ] Environment variables properly configured across services

### Development Environment

- [ ] Local development environment runs with single command
- [ ] Database seeding works for development data
- [ ] Hot reload works for both frontend and backend
- [ ] API documentation generates automatically
- [ ] Code quality checks pass on all commits

### Development Workflow

- [ ] Railway auto-deployment configured from Git
- [ ] Development environment runs locally with single command
- [ ] Code quality checks integrated with Git hooks
- [ ] Testing framework operational
- [ ] Database migrations work in development and production

### Monitoring

- [ ] Error tracking captures and reports issues
- [ ] Performance monitoring shows response times
- [ ] Railway monitoring and metrics configured
- [ ] Log aggregation works across all services

## Team Assignments

### DevOps Engineer (Lead)

- Railway infrastructure setup and configuration
- Monitoring and alerting configuration
- Security and environment management
- Database and Redis optimization

### Technical Lead

- Repository structure and coding standards
- Development environment setup
- Code quality tooling configuration
- Documentation framework

### Full-Stack Developers

- Local development environment testing
- API documentation setup
- Database migration scripts
- Integration testing setup

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies

- Railway account and billing setup
- Domain configuration and DNS setup
- Third-party service account setup (Sentry, LogRocket, Firebase, etc.)
- GitHub repository and team access

### Internal Dependencies

- None (foundational sprint)

## Risks & Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **Railway service limitations**: Test all required features early
- **Domain configuration delays**: Start DNS setup immediately
- **Third-party service integration**: Test cross-platform compatibility early

### Timeline Risks

- **Learning curve on new tools**: Allocate extra time for Railway setup
- **External service dependencies**: Have backup plans for each service
- **Cross-platform service setup**: Allow time for mobile compatibility testing

## Definition of Done

### Technical Completion

- [ ] All Railway services are deployed and operational
- [ ] Development environment documented and tested by team
- [ ] Auto-deployment from Git working correctly
- [ ] Monitoring captures errors and performance metrics
- [ ] Security configurations validated

### Documentation

- [ ] Infrastructure architecture documented
- [ ] Development setup guide created
- [ ] Deployment procedures documented
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide available

### Quality Assurance

- [ ] Load testing baseline established
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures tested
- [ ] Disaster recovery plan documented

## Success Metrics

- **Deployment Time**: Railway auto-deployment completes within 5 minutes
- **Local Development**: Environment starts in < 2 minutes
- **Uptime**: 99.9% availability target
- **Error Rate**: < 0.1% of requests result in 5xx errors

## Next Sprint Preparation

- Database schema design review
- API endpoint planning
- Authentication strategy finalization
- Team onboarding to development environment
