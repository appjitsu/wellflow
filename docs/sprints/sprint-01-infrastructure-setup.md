# Sprint 1: Infrastructure & Development Environment Setup

## Sprint Overview

**Duration:** 2 weeks  
**Story Points:** 8 points  
**Sprint Goal:** Establish foundational infrastructure, development environment,
and CI/CD pipeline for WellFlow MVP development.

## Sprint Objectives

1. Set up cloud infrastructure on Railway and Vercel
2. Establish development environment and tooling
3. Implement CI/CD pipeline with automated testing
4. Create project structure and coding standards
5. Set up monitoring and error tracking

## Deliverables

### 1. Cloud Infrastructure Setup

- **Railway Backend Setup**
  - NestJS API container configuration
  - PostgreSQL database with TimescaleDB extension
  - Redis instance for caching and background jobs
  - Environment variable management
- **Vercel Frontend Setup**
  - Next.js application deployment
  - Edge functions configuration
  - Domain and SSL certificate setup

### 2. Development Environment

- **Repository Structure**
  - Monorepo setup with proper folder organization
  - Shared TypeScript configurations
  - ESLint and Prettier configurations
  - Git hooks for code quality enforcement
- **Development Tooling**
  - Docker development environment
  - Database migration tools (Drizzle Kit)
  - API documentation setup (Swagger/OpenAPI)

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline

- **GitHub Actions Workflows**
  - Automated testing on pull requests
  - Deployment to staging environment
  - Production deployment pipeline
  - Database migration automation
- **Quality Gates**
  - Code coverage requirements (>80%)
  - Security scanning integration
  - Performance testing baseline

### 4. Monitoring & Observability

- **Error Tracking**
  - Sentry integration for error monitoring
  - LogRocket setup for user session recording
- **Performance Monitoring**
  - API response time tracking
  - Database query performance monitoring
  - Uptime monitoring setup

## Technical Requirements

### Infrastructure Components

```yaml
Railway Services:
  - NestJS API (Node.js 18+)
  - PostgreSQL 14+ with TimescaleDB
  - Redis 7+ for caching/jobs

Vercel Configuration:
  - Next.js 14+ with TypeScript
  - Edge functions enabled
  - Custom domain configuration

External Services:
  - Sentry (error tracking)
  - LogRocket (session recording)
  - UploadThing (file storage setup)
```

### Development Standards

- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled across all projects
- **Code Quality**: ESLint + Prettier with pre-commit hooks
- **Testing**: Jest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E
- **Documentation**: JSDoc for code, OpenAPI for APIs

## Acceptance Criteria

### Infrastructure

- [ ] Railway services deployed and accessible
- [ ] Vercel application deployed with custom domain
- [ ] Database migrations run successfully
- [ ] Redis connection established and tested
- [ ] SSL certificates configured and valid

### Development Environment

- [ ] Local development environment runs with single command
- [ ] Database seeding works for development data
- [ ] Hot reload works for both frontend and backend
- [ ] API documentation generates automatically
- [ ] Code quality checks pass on all commits

### CI/CD Pipeline

- [ ] Pull request builds run automatically
- [ ] Tests must pass before merge
- [ ] Staging deployment happens on main branch
- [ ] Production deployment requires manual approval
- [ ] Database migrations run automatically

### Monitoring

- [ ] Error tracking captures and reports issues
- [ ] Performance monitoring shows response times
- [ ] Uptime monitoring alerts on downtime
- [ ] Log aggregation works across all services

## Team Assignments

### DevOps Engineer (Lead)

- Railway and Vercel infrastructure setup
- CI/CD pipeline implementation
- Monitoring and alerting configuration
- Security scanning integration

### Technical Lead

- Repository structure and coding standards
- Development environment setup
- Code quality tooling configuration
- Documentation framework

### Full-Stack Developers

- Local development environment testing
- API documentation setup
- Database migration scripts
- Integration testing setup

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies

- Railway account and billing setup
- Vercel account and domain configuration
- Sentry and LogRocket account setup
- GitHub repository and team access

### Internal Dependencies

- None (foundational sprint)

## Risks & Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **Railway service limitations**: Test all required features early
- **Domain configuration delays**: Start DNS setup immediately
- **CI/CD complexity**: Use proven GitHub Actions templates

### Timeline Risks

- **Learning curve on new tools**: Allocate extra time for Railway setup
- **External service dependencies**: Have backup plans for each service

## Definition of Done

### Technical Completion

- [ ] All infrastructure services are deployed and operational
- [ ] Development environment documented and tested by team
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline successfully deploys to staging
- [ ] Monitoring captures errors and performance metrics
- [ ] Security scanning passes with no critical issues

### Documentation

- [ ] Infrastructure architecture documented
- [ ] Development setup guide created
- [ ] Deployment procedures documented
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide available

### Quality Assurance

- [ ] Load testing baseline established
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures tested
- [ ] Disaster recovery plan documented

## Success Metrics

- **Deployment Time**: < 5 minutes for staging deployment
- **Build Time**: < 3 minutes for CI/CD pipeline
- **Uptime**: 99.9% availability target
- **Error Rate**: < 0.1% of requests result in 5xx errors

## Next Sprint Preparation

- Database schema design review
- API endpoint planning
- Authentication strategy finalization
- Team onboarding to development environment

---

**Sprint 1 establishes the foundation for all subsequent development work.
Success here is critical for team velocity in future sprints.**
