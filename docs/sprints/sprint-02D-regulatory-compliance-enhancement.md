### 4. Environmental Compliance

#### **Environmental Monitoring**

- **Database Schema**: `environmental_monitoring` table
  - Air emissions tracking and LDAR programs
  - Water quality monitoring and discharge permits
  - Waste management and disposal tracking
  - Greenhouse gas reporting and carbon accounting
  - Continuous emission monitoring systems

#### **Waste Management**

- **Database Schema**: `waste_management` table
  - Produced water disposal and treatment
  - Drilling waste and mud management
  - Hazardous waste tracking and manifests
  - Waste minimization and recycling programs
  - Disposal facility management and compliance
