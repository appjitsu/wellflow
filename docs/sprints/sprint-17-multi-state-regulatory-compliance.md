## Technical Implementation

### Multi-State Regulatory Engine

```typescript
// State-specific regulatory adapter pattern
@Injectable()
export class RegulatoryEngineService {
  private adapters = new Map<string, RegulatoryAdapter>();

  constructor() {
    this.adapters.set('TX', new TexasRRCAdapter());
    this.adapters.set('NM', new NewMexicoOCDAdapter());
    this.adapters.set('OK', new OklahomaOCCAdapter());
    this.adapters.set('ND', new NorthDakotaNDICAdapter());
  }

  async submitReport(
    state: string,
    reportType: string,
    data: ProductionData
  ): Promise<SubmissionResult> {
    const adapter = this.adapters.get(state);
    return adapter.submitReport(reportType, data);
  }
}
```

### Deadline Tracking System

```typescript
// Automated deadline calculation and notification
@Injectable()
export class DeadlineTrackingService {
  async calculateDeadlines(
    well: Well,
    productionMonth: Date
  ): Promise<RegulatoryDeadline[]> {
    const state = well.state;
    const deadlines: RegulatoryDeadline[] = [];

    // State-specific deadline rules
    switch (state) {
      case 'TX':
        deadlines.push(this.calculateTRCDeadlines(well, productionMonth));
        break;
      case 'NM':
        deadlines.push(this.calculateOCDDeadlines(well, productionMonth));
        break;
      // ... other states
    }

    return deadlines;
  }

  async sendNotifications(deadline: RegulatoryDeadline): Promise<void> {
    // Email, SMS, and in-app notifications
    // Escalation procedures
    // Compliance tracking
  }
}
```

### State-Specific Validation Rules

```typescript
// Validation rules engine for each state
export class ValidationRulesEngine {
  private rules = new Map<string, ValidationRule[]>();

  validateProductionData(
    state: string,
    data: ProductionData
  ): ValidationResult {
    const stateRules = this.rules.get(state);
    return this.applyValidationRules(stateRules, data);
  }
}
```
