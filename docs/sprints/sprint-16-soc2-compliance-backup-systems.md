## Technical Implementation

### Database Backup Architecture

```typescript
// Automated backup service
@Injectable()
export class BackupService {
  async performDailyBackup(): Promise<BackupResult> {
    // Create point-in-time snapshot
    // Encrypt and compress backup
    // Upload to cross-region storage
    // Verify backup integrity
    // Update backup catalog
  }

  async testRecovery(): Promise<RecoveryTestResult> {
    // Automated recovery testing
    // Validate data integrity
    // Performance benchmarking
    // Generate test report
  }
}
```

### SOC 2 Compliance Monitoring

```typescript
// Compliance evidence collection
@Injectable()
export class ComplianceService {
  async collectSecurityEvidence(): Promise<ComplianceEvidence> {
    // Access control reviews
    // Security control testing
    // Audit log analysis
    // Policy compliance verification
  }
}
```

### Uptime Monitoring System

```typescript
// SLA monitoring and alerting
@Injectable()
export class UptimeMonitoringService {
  async checkSystemHealth(): Promise<HealthStatus> {
    // Database connectivity
    // API response times
    // External service availability
    // Resource utilization
  }
}
```
