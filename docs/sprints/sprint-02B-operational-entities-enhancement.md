# Sprint 2B: Operational Entities Enhancement

## Sprint Overview

**Duration:** 3 weeks  
**Story Points:** 15 points  
**Sprint Goal:** Implement comprehensive operational management entities to
support drilling programs, daily operations reporting, workovers, and field
operations management.

## ⚠️ **UPSTREAM SCHEMA INTEGRATION: Operational Excellence**

This sprint implements critical operational entities identified in the upstream
schema analysis, elevating WellFlow from basic well tracking to comprehensive
operational management.

## Sprint Objectives

1. Implement drilling program management and execution tracking
2. Build daily drilling reports system for operational oversight
3. Create workover management and intervention tracking
4. Establish well testing and performance monitoring
5. Implement field operations and maintenance scheduling

## Deliverables

### 1. Drilling Operations Management

#### **Drilling Programs**

- **Database Schema**: `drilling_programs` table
  - Well planning and execution tracking
  - Cost estimation and actual cost tracking
  - Casing, mud, bit, and cement programs (JSONB)
  - Directional planning and formation tops
  - Hazard analysis and risk assessment
  - Approval workflows and version control

#### **Daily Drilling Reports (DDR)**

- **Database Schema**: `daily_drilling_reports` table
  - Daily operational metrics and progress
  - Depth tracking (MD and TVD)
  - Rotating hours and non-productive time
  - Mud properties and bit performance
  - Personnel and weather conditions
  - Cost tracking and HSE incidents
  - Next operations planning

### 2. Well Intervention Management

#### **Workovers**

- **Database Schema**: `workovers` table
  - Workover planning and execution
  - Reason and work performed tracking
  - Cost estimation vs actual costs
  - Pre/post workover production comparison
  - AFE integration and approval tracking
  - Results analysis and lessons learned

#### **Enhanced Well Tests**

- **Database Schema**: Enhanced `well_tests` table
  - Comprehensive test data (rates, pressures, temperatures)
  - Test validation and witnessing
  - Choke management and flow conditions
  - Gas-liquid ratio and water cut analysis
  - Test duration and operational remarks

### 3. Field Operations & Maintenance

#### **Equipment Management**

- **Database Schema**: `equipment` table
  - Equipment tagging and specifications
  - Installation and maintenance scheduling
  - Manufacturer and model tracking
  - Status monitoring and lifecycle management
  - Well and facility associations

#### **Maintenance Scheduling**

- **Database Schema**: `maintenance_schedules` table
  - Preventive maintenance planning
  - Work order generation and tracking
  - Equipment downtime management
  - Cost tracking and vendor management
  - Compliance with regulatory requirements
